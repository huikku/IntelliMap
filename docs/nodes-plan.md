awesome — here’s a crisp, build-ready plan to make your graphs readable at every zoom while keeping LOC/complexity meaning.

# Goals

• Keep one canonical node shape (wide round-rect)
• Encode LOC + complexity consistently across zoom levels
• Reduce clutter at repo scale (aggregation + LOD)
• Add alternate views (matrix/treemap) for overview tasks
• Stay fast: cached layouts, WebGL styles, precomputed buckets

# 1) Data prep (one-time per graph build)

1. Compute per-file metrics:
   – loc, complexity (e.g., cyclomatic), runtime hotness (if available), changed status.
2. Compute quantile buckets:
   – loc_q ∈ {1..5}, cx_q ∈ {1..5}.
3. Compute aggregates for folders/packages (compound nodes):
   – sum(loc), mean/median(complexity), hotness, counts; and their quantiles.
4. Persist in graph.json:
   – node: {loc, loc_q, cx, cx_q, hot, changed, type, folderId}.
   – folder: {agg_loc, agg_loc_q, agg_cx, agg_cx_q, count}.
5. Community detection (optional): Louvain or Leiden; store community id for cluster coloring or grouping.

# 2) Layout presets (switchable)

• Default: ELK layered (down), edge straight, rank by import depth.
• Explore: fCoSE (force), edges bezier, community clustering.
• Diff: reuse Default, emphasize change via border color/stripe.
Cache node positions per filter set; only re-run when the node set changes.

# 3) Visual encoding (canonical)

Shape: round-rectangle; label wrap; high-contrast theme.
Primary size channel: width = log1p(loc), clamped to 80–240 px.
Height: fixed 40 px (preserves legibility).
Complexity: border thickness by cx_q (1–4 px).
Runtime hotness (if you have it): outer glow intensity.
Change state: border color (add/green, mod/yellow, del/red ghost).

# 4) Multi-resolution styling (zoom-aware)

Define three zoom bands with style switches and no relayout:

Low zoom (overview; e.g., <0.6)
• Collapse to folder/package compounds (only show compounds).
• Fill color: bivariate palette by (loc_q × cx_q).
• Border thickness: compound complexity bucket.
• Labels off; show “name (count)”.
• Edges, arrows hidden; edge opacity ~0.05.

Mid zoom (map view; 0.6–1.0)
• Show files; keep round-rects.
• Width by loc; height fixed.
• Bottom “metric strip” 2–3 px tall:
– left half encodes loc_q, right half encodes cx_q.
• Short labels (filename stem).
• Edges visible, arrows optional, opacity 0.2; selected neighborhood full opacity.

High zoom (detail; >1.0)
• Add internal dual bars:
– top bar = normalized LOC, bottom bar = normalized complexity.
• Exact values in tooltip/inspector; full path shown in inspector only.
• Edge arrows on.

Implementation notes:
• Add zoom class to the container (zoom-low, zoom-mid, zoom-high) on viewport change and toggle style arrays accordingly.
• Draw “metric strip” using node underlay or a tiny background image generated per bucket pair (fast and crisp).
• Pre-generate a 5×5 bivariate swatch for the legend and reuse its colors.

# 5) Aggregation & navigation

• Compound nodes: folder/package → files; collapse/expand on double-click or sidebar.
• “Changed only” and “High complexity only” toggles filter node set without re-computing layout (reuse cached).
• Neighborhood highlighting: hover dims non-neighbors; click pins the highlight.
• Keyboard: f = fit, c = center selection, +/- = zoom, 1/2/3 = layout presets.

# 6) Alternative views (tabs)

Adjacency Matrix
• Rows/cols = folders or files; order by community/dependency depth.
• Row bar = LOC; column bar = Complexity; cell = edge existence (weight optional).
• Click cell → select two nodes in graph and auto-zoom.

Treemap
• Rectangle area = LOC (sum); color = complexity bucket; depth = folder hierarchy.
• Click to drill; “Jump to Graph” focuses corresponding nodes.

Sankey (optional)
• Source layer → mid → leaf (e.g., routes → components → utils); link width by LOC flow; color by average complexity.

# 7) Legend & HUD

• Always-on mini legend:
– Width = LOC (log clamp), Border = Complexity (Q1–Q5), Glow = Runtime.
– Bivariate 5×5 grid swatch for low zoom.
• HUD shows zoom level, node/edge counts, filter state; updates on change.

# 8) Performance tactics

• WebGL renderer if available; fall back to canvas.
• Level-of-detail labels; hide below threshold.
• Debounce zoom events (e.g., 100 ms) before swapping style.
• Pre-bucket colors; avoid dynamic color scales per tick.
• Memoize node width from loc and reuse until graph changes.
• Worker for layout (ELK worker) to keep UI responsive.

# 9) QA & UX checks

• Snapshot tests for style-class switching across zoom thresholds.
• Visual regression for legend and color mapping.
• Large-repo smoke test (≥50k edges) for pan/zoom FPS and layout time.
• Usability: can a user answer
– “What are the biggest files?” (low zoom color)
– “Which files are most complex?” (border)
– “Where are hot runtime paths?” (glow)
– “What changed in this PR?” (border color)
in ≤10 seconds?

# 10) Milestones

M1: Metrics + buckets + compound aggregation in graph.json; Default layout with round-rects and width=LOC.
M2: Zoom-band style switching (low/mid/high), legend, metric strip.
M3: Folder collapse/expand, neighborhood dimming, cached layouts, diff styling.
M4: Matrix and Treemap tabs with cross-highlight to graph.
M5: Performance pass (WebGL, LOD labels, debounced events) and large-repo validation.
M6: UX polish (tooltips, keyboard, saved presets) + docs.

# 11) Telemetry (optional)

• Measure layout time, FPS, node/edge counts, zoom time, style swap time.
• Persist last view + filters per repo in localStorage for instant resume.

If you want next, I can generate exact Cytoscape style objects and the tiny zoom-band handler that flips classes, plus a bivariate palette table matching your theme.
